# Text-Based-Bank
This Coursera project will involve developing a Java banking application using the IntelliJ IDEA integrated development environment. The application will enable users to simulate real-life banking activities such as creating an account, adjusting the balance of an account, and viewing one's account balance. Additionally, the program will store basic demographic information for each account owner and generate a summary report of all accounts.
